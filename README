Flex abstractize is a clean implentation of the abstract notion into ActionScript.
It use Metatag and reflexion.

The differences with the other abstract implementation are:
	- clean implementation
	- easy to read
	- works with classes and methods
	- works with any abstract/concrete class hierarchy
	
	
Example:
[Abstract]
public class A {
	// constructor
	public class A():void {
		abstractize(this)
	}

	public class f():void {}

	[Abstract]
	public class f2():void {}
}


public class B extends A {
	public class f2():void {} // throws an error if this method is not set
}


In the current release, this functionality  is added as a function in the global package in order to keep it as simple as possible (no imports needed, no static calls) and because it should be IMO a build in functionality.
